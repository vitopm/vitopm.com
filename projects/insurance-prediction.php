                This was a personal project to implement a notebook that was originally made for my 4th semester mid exam. The data was an insurance data, which consisted of several columns, such as: age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and insurance charges.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The task was to do several processes on the data, such as data cleaning, missing data handling, visual exploratory data analysis, and machine learning model training with linear regression and prediction evaluation.

                This is the front first page you'll see when you open the streamlit. There is several information you have to fill before predicting the insurance charge.

                Here is the prediction result.

                It was pretty challenging because it was my first time learning Streamlit. I thought i wouldn't be able to finish this small side project, but apparently it was so fun learning new framework like Streamlit, the syntax simple and easy to learn.
